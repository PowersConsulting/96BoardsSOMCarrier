# 96BoardsSOMCarrier

These are assets for making a 96Boards SoM Carrier as described by the [Linaro spec v1.0](http://static.linaro.org/assets/specifications/96BoardsComputeSoMSpecificationV1.0.pdf).

Currently only Altium is being implemented, but expect to include similar KiCAD components if there is any interest.

## About

I couldn't find boilerplate assets from Linaro and/or partners, so I figured it was worth publishing this work. PRs are welcome. These assets are not known to work in actual hardware. No guarantees, use at your own risk.
