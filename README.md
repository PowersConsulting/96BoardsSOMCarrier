# 96BoardsSOMCarrier

These are assets for making a 96Boards SoM Carrier as described by the [Linaro spec v1.0](http://static.linaro.org/assets/specifications/96BoardsComputeSoMSpecificationV1.0.pdf). [Local copy](https://github.com/PowersConsulting/96BoardsSOMCarrier/blob/master/Documents/Specification/96BoardsComputeSoMSpecificationV1.0.pdf)

Currently only Altium is being implemented, but expect to include similar KiCAD components if there is any interest.

## Reference

Some choices have been informed by the only commercially available SoMs we could find, the [BeiQi/BearKey TB96-AI](http://www.bearkey.com.cn/product_detail.html?pid=TB-96AI) & [BeiQi/BearKey TB-96AIoT](http://www.bearkey.com.cn/product_detail.html?pid=TB-96AIoT). The published [TB96-AI schematics](https://www.96boards.org/documentation/som/tb-96ai/hardware-docs/files/tb-96ai-schematics.pdf) have some useful information.

## About

I couldn't find boilerplate assets from Linaro and/or partners, so I figured it was worth publishing this work. PRs are welcome. These assets are not known to work in actual hardware. No guarantees, use at your own risk.

Please give attribution. Referrals for hardware design consulting/contract work also welcome.
